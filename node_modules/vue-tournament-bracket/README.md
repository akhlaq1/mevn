                    player2: { id: "8", name: "Competitor 8", winner: true },
                }
            ]
        },
        //Third place play off
        {
            games: [
                {

                    player1: { id: "1", name: "Competitor 1", winner: false },
                    player2: { id: "5", name: "Competitor 5", winner: true },
                }
            ]
        },
        //Final
        {
            games: [
                {

### Player object

Player object requires: `id` property, `winner` is optional, rest is up to you - rendering is customizable via scoped slot.

- `id` is being used for highlighting
- `winner` property applies color for player accordingly, can be also `null` - player's color will be gray

### Styling

Apply your custom style by overriding `Bracket` component CSS. See [BracketNode.vue](./src/components/BracketNode.vue) for all styles being used.

## Development

Checkout repository and:
```
npm install
npm run serve
